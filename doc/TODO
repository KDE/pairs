Pairs to do Update to 2011-11-26

branch (new_qml2)

1) Make new icons for all the button (already asked plasma or oxigen channel no answare!)
2) put some scrollbar if the players are more than the space  on the monitor so that the add and remove button are no ovelapping
*3) Do not start a game if no players is selected
*4) Button text should be multilingual <-- Deafult is the language from the "locale" setting. There is also a command-line parameter --language to set it
*5) Start the game full screen <-- add a parameter for this
6) Eliminate the window border <-- there's none
7) In the game Logic and SoundLogic we need to highlight the first selected card of each turn
